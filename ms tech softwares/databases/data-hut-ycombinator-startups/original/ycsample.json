Even worse, theyre often unaware of who needs help because some students are too shy to raise hands. Classkick is a free app that eliminates those roadblocks, showing teachers exactly what their students are doing and who has pressed I need help on a specific part of their assignment. Rather than reinvent how students learn or how teachers teach, Classkick facilitates current classroom learning. In Classkick, every student's handwriting, whether its a 2nd grader drawing a picture or an 11th grader doing physics, appears live to the teacher in a mosaic of working students. The teacher can zoom into any students sheet to help them and ask a probing question to redirect their thinking. By the time the student has read and thought through the feedback, the teacher has already swept off and helped 5 others.We are hyper focused on one goal: increase student learning. To achieve this, we listen to educators to truly understand how technology can assist in the learning process.",

Antibodies are a growing class of drugs that have tremendous safety and efficacy advantages over small molecules; 7 of the top 10 selling drugs are antibodies, earning an average of $7B in revenue. However, antibodies- especially ones that activate and modulate cell surface receptors- are hard to find. Abalone Bio expands the playing field for antibody therapeutics and enables us to previously access treatments for untreated diseases.We have already discovered a novel antibody that activates a non-opioid receptor that produces analgesia. We are developing this antibody into a treatment for neuropathic pain  a medical condition that currently is treated with drugs like addictive opiates. The same molecule is also a potential treatment for inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, all 1B+ markets.",

Frustrated by the available tools for managing and analyzing Big Data in their research, the founders built a distributed, fault-tolerant, globally scalable data layer on top of Apache CouchDB.The service has grown since then. The team now manages and serves mobile and web app data on behalf of thousands of developers and hundreds of customers to their users around the world.

They have large data science teams that build such in-house recommendation engines. However, DTC brands can't afford to do this, and they don't have enough customer data to make the conventional recommendation approaches work. Suggestr uses innovative multi-modal AI technology that sees and understands products (needs 100x less data), allowing it to work with brands of all sizes (SME, mid-market, enterprise). The solution takes less than 30 minutes to integrate and helps merchants increase online store revenues by up to 10% with AI-driven upsells and cross-sells.",

These reviews and votes can be cast from the site's iPhone app or from the service's homepage. The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town.The gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a mob, which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too. It's definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay.",

Most retail pricing teams settle for making decisions in spreadsheets, shooting in the dark, and working backward from a cost-plus margin target, leaving a LOT of money on the table.Our founders experienced these problems at scale when they built pricing tech at Uber that made Uber a billion dollars in profit a year. They realized that retail was lacking the same quality and sophistication of price tooling. So, they built Luca.Luca is an AI-powered co-pilot for retail operators, which constantly identifies revenue and profit headroom, makes recommendations for price adjustments and saves countless work hours along the way.
